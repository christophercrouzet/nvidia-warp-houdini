"""Runs high-performance kernels on the CPU/GPU."""


== Overview ==

NVIDIA's Warp is a framework that provides access to running high-performance
kernels either on the CPU or GPU, all with the convenience of writing the code
in Python.

See the official reference pages for more information.

@parameters

Reset:
    #id: reset

    Resets the state of the simulation.

Start Frame:
    #id: startframe

    First frame to start solving on.

Substeps:
    #id: substeps

    Number of simulation steps to divide each frame into.

Device:
    #id: device

    Device used to allocate the memory and to launch kernels.

Run Over:
    #id: runover

    Run the kernel either once for each component of the selected class or
    for the provided number of times.


== Attributes ==

Count:
    #id: attr_count

    Number of geometry attributes to pass to the kernel.

Class:
    #id: attr_#_type

    What type the geometry attribute belongs to.

Access:
    #id: attr_#_access

    Type of access required for the geometry attribute.

    Read Only:
        Pulls the attribute values from the geometry before each step.

    Write Only:
        Pushes the attribute values onto the geometry after each step.

    Read and Write:
        Pulls then pushes the geometry attribute values during each step.

Name:
    #id: attr_#_name

    Name of the geometry attribute to access.


== Kernel ==

Source:
    #id: kernel_source

    Where the code for the kernel is sourced from.

Code:
    #id: kernel_source_embedded

    Code to use when the kernel source is embedded.

File:
    #id: kernel_source_file

    Path to use when the kernel source is a file.


@examples

:load_example: BouncingBall
    #examplefile: /examples/nodes/sop/nvidia--warp-0.0.1/BouncingBall.hda

    Simulates a ball bouncing on the floor.


:load_example: RippleDeformer
    #examplefile: /examples/nodes/sop/nvidia--warp-0.0.1/RippleDeformer.hda

    Applies a ripple deformer to a mesh.
